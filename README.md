# bcit-py-tools

## Quick Start

To run, install Python 3 and double-click app.pyw

## Single file executable without Python

Optionally, you can use [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to bundle the entire Python application with dependencies (including Python interpreter) into a single executable. Because it will be unsigned, it may receive a false positive warning for a Trojan/malware.
