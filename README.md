# bcit-py-tools

## Quick Start

1. Have Python 3.13.7 (3.10+ should work too) installed
2. Double click on app.pyw
3. If prompted to select an app to open the file, select Python, and click Always.
    * You can change the default app for .pyw files later by right clicking on a .pyw file and clicking Change next to the "Opens with" section. 
    
    For ease of use, you can create a shortcut on the desktop by right clicking app.pyw, hover over Send to, and click Desktop (create shortcut).   

## Single file executable without Python

Optionally, you can use [Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to bundle the entire Python application with dependencies (including Python interpreter) into a single executable. Because it will be unsigned, it may receive a false positive warning for a Trojan/malware.
